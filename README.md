# BufferTankModelling

We keep the different elements of the project in the folders *data*, *models*, *libraries* and *uppaal*.<br />
The *data* folder contains the historical data for weather and electricity prices.<br />
The *libraries* folder contains C Libraries we created to perform the following actions<br />
* facilitate the communication between the house model and the controller
* read historical data into the models
* read strategy decisions
* store data from the experiments into external files<br />

The *models* folder contains the Uppaal Stratego models of the buffer tank and mixing loop that we use for evaluation (EM.xml) and learning (LM.xml).<br />

To open the models, one must install Uppaal Stratego, which can be downloaded for free for non-commercial academic applications. The tool can be downloaded from the following [link](https://uppaal.org/).
